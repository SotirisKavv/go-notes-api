## ‚ú® Features

- **Complete CRUD API:** Create, read, update, delete notes with RESTful endpoints
- **Dual Storage:** SQLite database or in-memory storage (configurable)
- **Middleware Architecture:** Authentication and logging middleware chains
- **Database Integration:** SQLite with proper connection management
- **Authentication:** Token-based auth system with middleware
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive HTTP status codes and error responses

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```sh
# Install dependencies
go mod tidy

# Run with SQLite (requires CGO)
$env:CGO_ENABLED=1  # Windows PowerShell
go run .

# Test API endpoints
curl -Method POST http://localhost:8080/note \
  -Headers @{ "Authorization" = "Bearer mytoken"; "Content-Type" = "application/json" } \
  -Body '{ "title": "Todo", "body": "Learn Go", "user_id": 1 }'
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /notes` - List all notes (auth required)
- `GET /note/{id}` - Get specific note (auth required)  
- `POST /note` - Create new note (auth required)
- `PUT /note/{id}` - Update note (auth required)
- `DELETE /note/{id}` - Delete note (auth required)
